# 🌳 Project: Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript

This project implements a fully functional **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)** in JavaScript. It supports essential operations like insertion, deletion, search, traversals, height/depth checks, and balancing. The tree can automatically **rebalance itself** when it becomes unbalanced, and provides multiple traversal methods to explore its structure.
